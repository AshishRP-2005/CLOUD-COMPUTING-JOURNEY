#COMMANDS THAT HELP IN NAVIGATING BETWEEN FILES

[pwd] - important and basic command gives your current location in the linux file system

[echo ~] - gives absolute path to main directory (eg : /home/desktop/one drive)

[cd director_name] - goes to the directory whose name is specified, if it is present as a directory in the directory you are currently in

[cd ..] - goes back one step to the previous directory that you came from

[cd ~] - changes directory to main directory

#LISTS

[ls] - Returns list of files and directoris in the pwd, but doesn't return hidden files

[ls -a] - list of all files and directories in that pwd including hidden files

[ls -l] - long detailed(size, modification, date etc) list of files and directories, but no hidden files

[ls -la] - long list of all files and directories including hidden files
