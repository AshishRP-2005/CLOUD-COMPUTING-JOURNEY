whoami - displays/returns name of the current user

echo "whatever you want to say"  -  this command displays what has been written in {""} onto the screen

Ok so the users are divided into groups in linux, no idea what these groups are, {i will figure it as i move forward}
To get the data on which groups you part of u can use
id - returns uid(user id), gid(group id), groups

id root - this provides info about the admin
