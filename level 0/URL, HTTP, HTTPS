The Client–Server Model
I am the client, think internet is just a restaurant, if i ask a question. The other computer that answers me is the server

What happens when I enter a URL?
Domain name is looked up (example: google.com) 
DNS server replies with IP address
↓
My computer calls that IP, at port 443
↓
they meet and perform a digital handshake (TCP handshake)
↓
HTTP - my computer requests a file, basically says “hello, give me this”
↓
Server replies “sure, here you go”
↓
Rendering in browser
browser takes the file code, threads work on it, page is rendered on my end

Note 1 :
Why ports matter?
If we used the same port for everything, computer wouldn’t know
which incoming data does what
it would also get overloaded
(bandwidth issue)

Note 2 :
DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS is important
It’s the system that tells
the IP address of a computer

Basically a name → number translator


HTTP vs HTTPS

HTTP - {Unprotected} Anyone can see, what you’re doing

HTTPS - {Protected} This is locked, Uses SSL / TLS encryption, Only you and the server, have the key
