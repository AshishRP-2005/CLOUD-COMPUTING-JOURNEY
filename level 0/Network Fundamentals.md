Network Fundamentals

Address (How to find a comp on the internet)
-IP address: 192.168.1.1
-Port: 80 / 443
-DNS: google.com

Note :
IP address is the apartment 
Port no is the room no → this matters, cause a computer (apartment) has different doors (ports) for different deliveries (paths)
eg: Port 80 / 443 → door for web traffic

DNS (Domain Naming System)
just a fancy name to call an IP address
cause who tf can remember numbers
