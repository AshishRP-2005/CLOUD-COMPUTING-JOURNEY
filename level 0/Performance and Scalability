Performance & Scalability

Bandwidth - wideness of the pipe
think of it as a highway
6 lanes = more data passed at one time
great while downloading large files

Latency - speed limit of the internet
even with great bandwidth
if speed of data transfer is low
UX seems laggy because of wait time

CDN (Content Delivery Networks)
see, data needs to travel
from point A → B
over a large distance through cables & wires
this takes time, time which causes latency
→ Solution: CDN

instead of sending data only, from point A
we place multiple points
C, D, E, F… along the path
the nearest point to B
sends the data instead of A

Note 1 :
Zombie Server Problem
server is UP, but not loading,is it a website issue or just timing out?

Reasons
CPU & RAM exhaustion
Connection limit - {there are only a set number of open ports at a time}

Too long of a line to go in a queue
→ so a 30 sec delay

Note 2 :
If RAM is full
OS moves things to disk
disk is very slow
this back and forth between ram and disk is called thrashing
