Anatomy of a computer

→ CPU (brain)
very fast
0 term memory

→ Disk / SSD
slower
long term storage
all files & data are here

→ RAM
workspace
fast to reach
temporary
when killed / closed, memory wiped

Upgrading → RAM → more area to work with (multitasking)
Upgrading → DISK → faster loading of heavy apps → CPU gets items faster
(“This explains why clearing storage makes phones faster”)

How does it boot?
computer does not know what an OS is
instead it has BIOS / UEFI,
which tells the system to go find the OS in the SSD and bring it to RAM to start working
