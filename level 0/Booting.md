Booting
+So CPU has nothing
+When switched on,

It’s exact path to OS looks like this
ON → (CPU checks for BIOS)
↓
BIOS checks in everything is running(Checks RAM, checks CPU, checks disk, etc.)
↓
Then BIOs looks for Boot Loader
↓
Boot Loader
finds OS
moves OS to RAM
↓
Once OS is in RAM
CPU starts following OS instructions

Note 1:
BIOS (small chip on motherboard)
runs checks on each system
before finding Boot Loader

Boot Loader is a “scout”
it finds OS in disk
& pushes it to RAM

BIOS is a POST system (Power-ON Self-Test)

Note 2:
The GPU (graphic card)
helps talking b/w monitor
& CPU (found in POST)
